# In Python, you don't need to specify the type of the variable
# Python is a dynamically typed language, which means that you can reassign variables to different data types
# Example
student_count = 1000
print(student_count)  # 1000
student_count = "1000"
print(student_count)  # 1000

# You can assign multiple variables in one line
# Example
x, y = 1, 2
print(x, y)  # 1 2
